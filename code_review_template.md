Code Review

- Are the commit messages properly formatted?
- Are the branch names properly formatted? Are they consistent with the naming convention we determined as a group?
- Are the variables named properly and clearly in this code?
(Arrays are plural, etc)
- Are functions in this code named properly?
(Starts with an action verb, describes what the function does)
- Are any of the functions super long or doing too much? Can any parts be broken out into smaller, more modular helper functions?
- Are there any parts of this code that I don't understand and need to review on a call with my partner?
